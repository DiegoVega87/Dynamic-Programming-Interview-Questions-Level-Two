public class RoadNetworkUniquePaths {

    /*
    * As a startup built to solve the problem of efficient commuting for city dwellers, we need to find the number of
    * unique paths between two intersections in a given road network. We have the number of intersections and the
    * number of roads connecting these intersections. As a commuter, you can only travel in the forward direction along
    * the roads. Given this information, write a function that returns the number of unique paths from the starting
    * intersection to the destination intersection.
    *
    * Example 1:
    * int n = 4;
    * int[][] roads = {{0, 1}, {0, 2}, {1, 2}, {2, 3}};
    * int start = 0;
    * int end = 3;
    * int expectedOutput = 2;
    *
    * Example 2:
    * int n = 5;
    * int[][] roads = {{0, 1}, {0, 2}, {1, 2}, {2, 3}, {3, 4}};
    * int start = 0;
    * int end = 4;
    * int expectedOutput = 1;
    *
    * Example 3:
    * int n = 4;
    * int[][] roads = {{0, 1}, {0, 2}, {1, 2}, {2, 3}};
    * int start = 1;
    * int end = 3;
    * int expectedOutput = 1;
