    /*
    * As a growing startup, we want to analyze the performance of our sales team. To do this, we need to find the length
    * of the longest increasing sequence of our monthly sales data stored in an integer array. Write a function that
    * takes in the array and returns the length of the longest increasing subsequence. This will help us identify the
    * salesperson with the highest sales growth rate and improve our overall sales performance.
    *
    * Example 1:
    * int[] salesData = {1, 3, 2, 4, 6, 5, 8, 7, 9};
    * int result = longestIncreasingSubsequence(salesData);
    * System.out.println(result); // Output: 6, )
    *
    * Example 2:
    * int[] salesData = {10, 9, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1};
    * int result = longestIncreasingSubsequence(salesData);
    * System.out.println(result); // Output: 1
    * */
