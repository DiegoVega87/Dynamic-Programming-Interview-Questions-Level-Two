    /*
    * As a startup, we are developing a cash register system that can make the fewest number of coins for any amount
    * of money. Given an array coins that stores all available coins (1ct, 2ct etc...)  and the price amount, return the
    * smallest number of coins and bills possible to pay the price. Return -1 if the given coins are not suitable to pay
    * the exact price.
    *
    * Example 1:
    *
    * int[] coins = {1, 5, 10, 25};
    * int price = 76;
    * int expectedOutput = 4;
    *
    * Example 2:
    * int[] coins = {1, 5, 10, 25};
    * int price = 99;
    * int expectedOutput = 9;
